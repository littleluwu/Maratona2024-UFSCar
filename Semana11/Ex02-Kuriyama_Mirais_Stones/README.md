# 💎 Kuriyama Mirai's Stones

**Fonte: [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/433/B)**

Kuriyama Mirai has killed many monsters and got many (namely $n$) stones. She numbers the stones from $1$ to $ n$. The cost of the $i$-th stone is $v_i$. Kuriyama Mirai wants to know something about these stones so she will ask you two kinds of questions:

1. She will tell you two numbers, $l$ and $r$ ($1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n$), and you should tell her $\sum_{i=l}^r v_i$. 

2. Let $u_i$ be the cost of the $i$-th cheapest stone (the cost that will be on the $i$-th place if we arrange all the stone costs in non-decreasing order). This time she will tell you two numbers, $l$ and $r$ ($1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n$), and you should tell her $\sum_{i=l}^r u_i$

For every question you should give the correct answer, or Kuriyama Mirai will say "fuyukai desu" and then become unhappy.

### Entrada
The first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5$). The second line contains n integers: $v_1, v_2, ..., v_n$ ($1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9$) — costs of the stones.

The third line contains an integer $m$ ($1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5$) — the number of Kuriyama Mirai's questions. Then follow m lines, each line contains three integers $type$, $l$ and $r$ ($1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n$; $1 ≤ type ≤ 2$), describing a question. If $type$ equal to $1$, then you should output the answer for the first question, else you should output the answer for the second one.

### Saída
Print $m$ lines. Each line must contain an integer — the answer to Kuriyama Mirai's question. Print the answers to the questions in the order of input.
