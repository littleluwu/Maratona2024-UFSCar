# 👧 Little Girl and Maximum Sum

**Fonte: [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/276/C)**

The little girl loves the problems on array queries very much.

One day she came across a rather well-known problem: you've got an array of $n$ elements (the elements of the array are indexed starting from 1); also, there are q queries, each one is defined by a pair of integers $l_i, r_i$ ($1≤l_i≤r_i≤n$). You need to find for each query the sum of elements of the array with indexes from $l_i$ to $r_i$, inclusive.

The little girl found the problem rather boring. She decided to reorder the array elements before replying to the queries in a way that makes the sum of query replies maximum possible. Your task is to find the value of this maximum sum.

### Entrada
The first line contains two space-separated integers $n$ ($1≤n≤2⋅10^5$) and q ($1≤q≤2⋅10^5$) — the number of elements in the array and the number of queries, correspondingly.

The next line contains $n$ space-separated integers $a_i$ ($1≤a_i≤2⋅10^5$) — the array elements.

Each of the following $q$ lines contains two space-separated integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1≤l_i≤r_i≤n$) — the $i$-th query.

### Saída
In a single line print, a single integer — the maximum sum of query replies after the array elements are reordered.

Please, do not use the `%lld` specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the `cin`, `cout` streams or the `%I64d` specifier.
