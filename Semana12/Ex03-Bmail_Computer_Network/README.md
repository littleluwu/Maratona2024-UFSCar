# 📧 Bmail Computer Network

Once upon a time there was only one router in the well-known company Bmail. Years went by and over time new routers were purchased. Every time they bought a new router, they connected it to one of the routers bought before it. You are given the values $p_i$ — the index of the router to which the $i$-th router was connected after being purchased ($p_i<i$).

There are $n$ routers in Boogle in total now. Print the sequence of routers on the path from the first to the $n$-th router.

### Entrada
The first line contains integer number $n$ ($2≤n≤200000$) — the number of the routers. The following line contains $n−1$ integers $p_2,p_3,…,p_n$ ($1≤p_i<i$), where $p_i$ is equal to index of the router to which the $i$-th was connected after purchase.

### Saída
Print the path from the $1$-st to the $n$-th router. It starts with $1$ and ends with $n$. All the elements in the path should be distinct.
