The heroic outlaw Robin Hood is famous for taking from the rich and giving to the poor.

Robin encounters $n$ people starting from the $1$-st and ending with the $n$-th. The $i$-th person has $a_i$ gold. If $a_i≥k$, Robin will take all $a_i$ gold, and if $a_i=0$, Robin will give 1 gold if he has any. Robin starts with 0 gold.

Find out how many people Robin gives gold to.
