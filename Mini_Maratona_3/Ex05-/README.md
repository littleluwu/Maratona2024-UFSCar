# 🧮 Collatz Conjecture

**Fonte: [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1982/B)**

Recently, the first-year student Maxim learned about the Collatz conjecture, but he didn't pay much attention during the lecture, so he believes that the following process is mentioned in the conjecture:

There is a variable $x$ and a constant $y$. The following operation is performed $k$ times:

- increase $x$ by 1, then
- while the number $x$ is divisible by $y$, divide it by $y$.

Note that both of these actions are performed sequentially within one operation.
For example, if the number $x=16$, $y=3$, and $k=2$, then after one operation $x$ becomes 17, and after another operation $x$ becomes 2, because after adding one, $x=18$ is divisible by 3 twice.

Given the initial values of $x$, $y$, and $k$, Maxim wants to know what is the final value of $x$.

### Entrada
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1≤t≤10^4$) — the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three integers $x$, $y$, and $k$ ($1≤x$,$k≤10^9$, $2≤y≤10^9$) — the initial variable, constant and the number of operations.

### Saída
For each test case, output a single integer — the number obtained after applying $k$ operations.
